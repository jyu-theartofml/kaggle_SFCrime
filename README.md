# kaggle_SFCrime
This is the readme file for Kaggle SF crime data prediction ( April 2016)
 
<p>This repository is created for the Kaggle SF crime prediction project. In the file name <i>SF crime(1).ipynb</i>, Bernoulli Naive Bayes method was used as the predictive model, and 
in <i>SF crime(2).ipynb</i>, XGB classifier was used and provided slightly better results. For both methods, weekeday was extracted, and one-hot-encoding was performed for the 
categorical variables.</p>

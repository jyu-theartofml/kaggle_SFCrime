SF crime data prediction ( April 2016)
This is the readme file. 
This repository is created for the Kaggle SF crime prediction project. In the file name *SF crime(1).ipynb*, Bernoulli Naive Bayes method was used as the predictive model, and 
in *SF crime(2).ipynb*, XGB classifier was used and provided slightly better results. For both methods, weekeday was extracted, and one-hot-encoding was performed for the 
categorical variables.
